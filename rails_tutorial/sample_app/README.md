# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

# Notes

The apps were not published to Heroku because they need to be in the git root for heroku to work properly. We did not want to set up separate git repositories for the apps.
